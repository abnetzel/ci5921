TRANSCRIPT OF CREATING ACCESSIBLE YOUTUBE VIDEOS: UPLOADING A VIDEO

[bouncy piano intro]
When it's time to upload a video to YouTube,
you can often use your video editing software,
such as Camtasia, to send the video directly to your YouTube account.

However, if your account has multiple channels,
you'll need to export your video so that it's a standalone file
saved locally to your computer or storage device.
YouTube's Upload button will allow you to upload the video file
to the desired channel.

I've already exported my video and I'd like to add it
to my discipline's YouTube channel.

From my department's account, I'll click the Account Picture
and select the channel I need.
Then I'll click Upload,
click the Public drop-down arrow,
and select Private,
so no one can view the video
until I've prepared its captions.

Click Select files to upload,
and then I'll locate my video.
As the video uploads and processes,
I'll give it a descriptive, but short, title;
a short description;
and I'll add it to a playlist.

The information on this screen looks pretty good,
so I'll click Done to confirm all of my changes.
Uploading videos to YouTube is a quick process
that allows you to build your video library in just a few steps.
